# TechFit: Advanced Fitness Tracking Application with ML Integration

## Project Overview
TechFit is an innovative fitness tracking application that combines real-time exercise monitoring with machine learning capabilities for enhanced workout analysis and equipment maintenance.

## GitHub Repository
- Repository: [https://github.com/Kheria1509/tech_fit_app.git](#) (Replace with your actual GitHub link)
- Branch: main
- Project Type: Flutter Application

## Key Features

### 1. Exercise Tracking System
- Real-time monitoring of vital exercise metrics:
  - Heart rate
  - Speed
  - Calories burned
  - Distance covered
  - Exercise zones

### 2. Machine Learning Integration

#### A. Anaerobic Threshold (AT) Detection
- Implements classification model for real-time AT detection
- Features used for AT detection:
  - Heart rate patterns
  - Speed variations
  - Exercise duration
  - User fitness level
- Technologies:
  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  model = RandomForestClassifier()
  # Features: [heart_rate, speed, duration, fitness_level]
  # Labels: [pre_AT, AT_point, post_AT]
  ```

#### B. Gear Failure Prediction System
- Predictive maintenance using classification learning
- Monitors equipment health metrics:
  - Vibration patterns
  - Usage duration
  - Load patterns
- Implementation:
  ```python
  from sklearn.svm import SVC
  gear_model = SVC(kernel='rbf')
  # Features: [vibration, usage_hours, load]
  # Labels: [normal, warning, critical]
  ```

### 3. User Management
- Firebase Authentication
- Personalized profiles
- Exercise history tracking
- Goal setting and progress monitoring

### 4. Technical Implementation

## Machine Learning Model Details

### AT Detection Model
```python
def train_at_detection_model(data):
    features = ['heart_rate', 'speed', 'duration', 'fitness_level']
    X = data[features]
    y = data['at_state']
    
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model
```

### Gear Failure Prediction
```python
def predict_gear_failure(sensor_data):
    # Process sensor data
    features = extract_features(sensor_data)
    
    # Make prediction
    status = gear_model.predict(features)
    
    # Notify if maintenance needed
    if status in ['warning', 'critical']:
        send_maintenance_notification()
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Real-time Data Processing
```dart
void processExerciseData(ExerciseDataPoint data) {
    // Process heart rate for AT detection
    List<double> features = [
        data.heartRate,
        data.speed,
        data.duration,
        userData.fitnessLevel
    ];
    
    // Check for AT point
    bool isAT = mlService.detectAT(features);
    
    // Process equipment sensors
    bool needsMaintenance = mlService.checkGearHealth(sensorData);
    if (needsMaintenance) {
        notifyMaintenance();
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Enhanced ML model accuracy with larger datasets
2. Integration with more fitness equipment
3. Advanced predictive analytics for user performance
4. Real-time equipment health monitoring dashboard

## Conclusion
TechFit demonstrates the successful integration of fitness tracking with machine learning capabilities, providing both users and gym owners with valuable insights for exercise optimization and equipment maintenance.
